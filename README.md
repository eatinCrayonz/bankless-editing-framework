# bankless-editing-framework
The development of an editing framework and style guide for official and public docs of the Bankless DAO

We want a framework through which the writers of the official docs can work in that will help guide them with proper voice and tense, and we want a stylistic set of guidelines that our editor team can work with to handle crypto-specific grammar (when to use all caps, symbols, etc).
