# Bankless Writing Framework for Consistency Across Official Docs

What follows are a set of guidelines designed to provide a framework within
which all official DAO documents and public-facing writing will adhere to in
order to provide consistency across all channels and present a unified and
professional front.

## I. Definitions

The following words are defined in order to clearly state what is meant by
each in the rest of this framework:

1. Crypto-native. Any term or phrase that has originated within the
cryptocurrency space as a result of necessity or memes; i.e Ethereum, $ETH, LP, HODL, "to the moon", etc.



## II. Verbiage

1. Use of jargon should be limited to internal communications wherever
possible.

2. When use of jargon is unavoidable, or preferred, crypto-native words
should be clearly defined when they are first mentioned, to reduce confusion
in the rest of the document.
